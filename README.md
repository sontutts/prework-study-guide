# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project was built to help Bootcamp students study and remember what they were taught to build a website. This webpage allows important information to be located in one place so the Bootcsmp students can access it when they need it. While building this project, I learned the components and steps to building a quality webpage. I also learned how to use web development tools in order to inspect the functionality of the website.
